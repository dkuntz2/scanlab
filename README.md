# Scanlab

quickly turn photos of negatives into positives.

## workflow

1.  "scan" your film negatives using a digital camera and a light table.
1.  run `scanlab` over the directory of images.
1.  enjoy tiffs of the raw files converted into positives.

## notes

the code currently only supports RAF (fujifilm raw) files, but technically it can support anything `libraw` supports.
I haven't had that need yet so I didn't put it in.
